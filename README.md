# Bosch-IoT-Showcase

## Overview
- The XDK 110 is a programmable sensor. See details here: http://xdk.bosch-connectivity.com/. "I’m a programmable sensor device & a prototyping platform for any IoT use case you can imagine."
- We have developed a client (the Solace MQTT XDK App) which connects via MQTT to the event mesh.
- with our partners we have created a few user / business applications:
  - **SL Corporation:RTView**, a real-time dashboard for visualizing the XDK sensor data (https://sl.com/products/rtview-cloud-for-iot/)
  - **Datawatch:Panopticon**, a streaming analytics tool to analyze the XDK sensor data in real-time (https://www.datawatch.com/our-platform/panopticon-streaming-analytics/)
  - **Dell Boomi:Flow**, a web-based user application to command & control the XDK App (https://boomi.com/platform/flow/)
  - **Solace:Solace Cloud**, to provide the event mesh (https://solace.com/cloud/)
