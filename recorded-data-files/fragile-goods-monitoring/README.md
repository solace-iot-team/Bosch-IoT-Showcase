# Monitoring the Transport of Fragile Goods

## Scenario:

Monitoring the Transport of fragile goods.

* device is mounted on pallete or container
* device connects to 'on-truck/train/van/ship' gateway
* gateway acts as a data logger and connects via cellular or satellite network to a Solace Regional Edge Broker

## Goal

Detect shock above tolerated levels which indicates that goods may be damaged.

## Vision

* correlate shock with:
  - current custodian of goods (producer, forwarder, customs, port, receiver, ...)
  - location of goods
* record transactions in a trusted ledger
  - use of distributed ledger technology
  - record hand-over of custody
  - record location
  - record sensor data - raw
  - record analytics data (shock detection) with
    - acceptance by parties

## Benefits

* **cost reduction for insurance disputes**
* **reduction of additional quality control/inspection costs**
* **early replacement of damaged goods (0.9 probability) reduces impact on production/business**
