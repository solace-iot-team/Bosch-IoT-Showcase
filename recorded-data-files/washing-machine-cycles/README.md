# Record Data

## Scenario:

washing machine cycles

## Goal
* detect washing cycle
  - wash period / duration
  - spinning cycle period / duration
* count number of washing cycles per time period
  - e.g. average is 2 cycles per week

## Vision
* send offer to household for washing powder and other consumables
  - predict consumption based on recorded cycles
  - understand last purchase amount and compare
    - household may be purchasing competition
* predict de-scaling requirement
  - correlate with water hardness in area
    - based on WIFI/cell tower location, use a web-service to get details
  - correlate with historical records for this particular machine
    - when would the machine need de-scaling?
  - send instructions for de-scaling
    - with offer
* detect / predict issue
  - with the installation of the machine
    - vibration paramters out of range indicates bad positioning
    - send instructions / advice to household
    - offer maintenance person visit based on household insight (e.g. single, older person)
  - non expected vibration patterns:
    - machine might be failing and in need of repair soon
    - predict failure
    - advise household and offer to send maintenance person

## Benefits

* **sell more washing machines**
* **sell more consumables**
* **sell partner maintenance services**
